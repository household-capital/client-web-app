        reporting bodies (<b>​CRBs</b>​) may provide your personal information and credit-related information to credit
        providers to assist in assessing your credit worthiness, what happens if you fail to meet your credit
        obligations or commit a serious credit infringement (including our right to report a default or a serious credit
        infringement to CRBs), your right to request that CRBs not use your credit-related information for the purposes

        consumer and commercial credit-related information.<br><br>

        <b>Exchange information with credit providers.</b> ​We may exchange your personal information and credit-related

        <b>Overseas Disclosure.</b>​ We may disclose your personal information and credit-related information to
        overseas
        entities, including related entities and service providers located overseas in USA, Canada, Malaysia, India,

        Whilst we attempt to select and secure reputable offshore service providers, we are not liable for any breach or
        misuse of information sent offshore. An overseas entity may not be subject to privacy laws or principles similar
        to those which apply in Australia, and any information disclosed to an overseas entity may not have the same
        protection as under the Australian privacy law. You may not be able to seek redress for any breach of your
