Further to our recent conversation, I am pleased to be able to provide you with the following information.<br><br>

I understand that your client’s details are as follows:<br>
{% if obj.client_name|length > 0 %}- {{ client_name}}<br>{% endif %}
{% if obj.loanType == 1 %}- joint borrowers, who are aged {{ obj.age_1 }} and {{ obj.age_1 }} <br>
{% else %}- an individual borrower who is currently aged {{ obj.age_1 }}<br>{% endif %}
- living in {% if obj.dwellingType == 1 %}an apartment {% else %}a house {% endif %}
{% if street|length > 0 %}at {{ street }}{% endif %}<br>
- in the postcode {{ obj.postcode|intBlank }}<br>
- with an estimated valuation of approximately ${{ obj.valuation|intcomma }}<br><br>

Based on this high level information and subject to credit assessment, we may be able to provide a Household Loan with a loan-to-value ratio of up to <b>{{eligibility.restrictions.maxLVR}}%</b> or <b>${{eligibility.restrictions.maxLoan|intcomma}}</b>.<br><br>


As you know, Household has certain loan restrictions that are based on the intended purpose of the loan.  Potential restrictions may include the following:<br>
{% if eligibility.restrictions.maxLoan > restrictions.maxCare %}- Maximum amount for Age Care: ${{ eligibility.restrictions.maxCare|intcomma }}<br>{% endif %}
{% if eligibility.restrictions.maxLoan > restrictions.maxTopUp %}- Maximum amount for Super Top Up: ${{ eligibility.restrictions.maxTopUp|intcomma }}<br>{% endif %}
{% if eligibility.restrictions.maxLoan > restrictions.maxReno %}- Maximum amount for Renovations: ${{ eligibility.restrictions.maxReno|intcomma }}<br>{% endif %}
- Maximum amount for Refinance: ${{ eligibility.restrictions.maxRefi|intcomma }}<br>
- Maximum amount for Accelerated Giving: ${{ eligibility.restrictions.maxGive|intcomma }}<br>
- Maximum amount for Transport and Travel: ${{ eligibility.restrictions.maxTravel|intcomma }}<br><br>

We would be pleased to meet with you and your client to determine whether a Household Loan might be appropriate.  If you would like any further information, please don’t hesitate to contact me.<br><br>

Kind regards<br>
