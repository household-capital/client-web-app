## Environment and Execution
As a python framework, Django is very dependent on python and its dependencies.  This application is written for Django 2.2.1 or later, which is itself dependent on Python3.  Python provides a light container to keep all the related python files together (virtualenv).  When in the virtual environment, anything installed using PIP will be saved to that environment only.  You can review the contents of that envionment by running
 PIP freeze.

The provisioning script calls for a virtualenv called 'env' located at ~/.virtualenvs.  This is separate from the project directory at ~/django_project

To execute the program you must enter the virtual environment first and then run.  Specifically:
```
source ~/.virtualenvs/myenv/bin/activate
cd ~/django_project
python manage.py runserver
``` 


## Background - Django
```
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. 
Itâ€™s free and open source.
```
Django's documentation is excellent (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/)



## Background - Django Structure
Django follows a Model:View:Controller design with a slight twist - it is more accurately Model:Template:View.  

In Django you have:
#### The Model
- Database which is abstracted through an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) which means you call functions and methods on the object rather than passing SQL (it creates the SQL at a lower level);

#### The View
- which is the controller, it receives requests via URLs and responds to them by bringing together the Model (if applicable), forms (if applicable) and passes any required information (called context) to the template engine;

#### The Template
- the template engine renders an HTML template (which can be comprised of multiple HTML files), with corresponding CSS or Javascript, filling the template variables with information that is passed from the View in the context.

So the basic request-response cycle is:
+ an http request is received (e.g., from a browser) and routed based on URL pattern to a view
+ the view gathers required data from the model, presents a form (GET) or receives form information (POST) and performs required calculations or actions
+ the view may redirect to another page or render a page via template.  It will pass required 'context' to a template
+ the template engine will build the required HTML using the context and associated form, css, javascript etc
+ an http response will be delivered back to the browser

## Background - Django File Structure
Based on the above - the file structure becomes clearer:
#### Apps 
Applications can be as narrow or as broader as appropriate, but with a conventional approach to be smaller and specific - do one thing well, rather than sprawling.  Each app has the same substructure:
- urls.py  - mapping of urls to views
- views.py - contains all of the views which control the content/response - typically will point to a template
- forms.py - contains the definition information for forms to be rendered on a page (called from the view)
- models.py - has the database definitions and procedures to retrieve/save data (called from the view)

#### Templates 
HTML templates are saved here (referenced by views).  This is straight HTML but include template references {{establishmentFee}} and logic {% if template != 0 %} {% endif %} etc.

#### Static
Static files - css, images, javascript are stored here.  Typically referenced by a template.

#### Config
The main Django configuration / settings files are located in this directory.

#### Manage.py
This simple file is at the top of the structure and is used to start the application (e.g., python manage.py runserver)

## Background - Client App Example
A request to https://householdcapital.app/client/live1 will:
- be routed from urls.py to a view ```path('live1', views.Live1.as_view(), name='live1')```
- the view in views.py will construct the response using a template and in this case a form 
```
class Live1(LoginRequiredMixin, ClientDataMixin, FormView): 
   template_name = "client_1_0/live1.html"
   form_class=renovateAmountForm
   success_url = reverse_lazy('client:live2') 
```
- the template is in the templates directory
- the form is in forms.py
```
class renovateAmountForm(forms.Form):
        #Form Fields
        renovateAmount = forms.CharField(max_length=10, label='Amount', required=True)
        renovateDescription = forms.CharField(max_length=40, label='Description', required=False)

        #Form Layout
        helper = FormHelper()
        helper.form_id = 'clientForm'
        helper.form_method = 'POST'
```
- an http response will be returned putting these components together.

## Background - Class Based Views
This app utilises CBVs which are standard view classes that perform the main Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks.  These views can be overiddend and added to (mixins) using pythons ability to multi-subclass.

The main CBVs used here are TemplateView (renders a template) and FormView (renders a template and a form).
